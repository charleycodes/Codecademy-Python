# As a refresher, let's start off by writing a function to print out the list of grades, one element at a time.

# Define a function on line 3 called print_grades() with one argument, a list called grades.
# Inside the function, iterate through grades and print each item on its own line.
# After your function, call print_grades() with the grades list as the parameter.

grades = [100, 100, 90, 40, 80, 100, 85, 70, 90, 65, 90, 85, 50.5]

def print_grades(grades):
    for grade in grades: # print each grade in the list grades
        print grade

print_grades(grades) # returns each grade printed out on its own line

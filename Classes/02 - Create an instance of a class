# We can use classes to create new objects, which we say are instances of those classes.

# Creating a new instance of a class is as easy as saying:

"""
newObject = ClassName()
"""

# Instructions
# Below your Car class, create a new object named my_car that is an instance of Car.

class Car(object):
   pass
my_car = Car()

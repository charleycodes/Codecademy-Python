# There is a special function named __init__() that gets called whenever we create a new instance of a class. It exists by default, 
# even though we don't see it. However, we can define our own __init__() function inside the class, overwriting the default version. 
# We might want to do this in order to provide more input variables, just like we would with any other function.

T# he first argument passed to __init__() must always be the keyword self - this is how the object keeps track of itself internally - 
# but we can pass additional variables after that.

# In order to assign a variable to the class (creating a member variable), we use dot notation. For instance, if we passed newVariable 
# into our class, inside the __init__() function we would say:

"""
self.new_variable = new_variable
"""

# Instructions
# Define the __init__() function of the Car class to take four inputs: self, model, color, and mpg. Assign the last three inputs to 
# member variables of the same name by using the self keyword.

# Then, modify the object my_car to provide the following inputs at initialization:

"""
model = "DeLorean"
color = "silver"
mpg = 88
"""

# You don't need to include the self keyword when you create an instance of a class, because self gets added to the beginning of your 
# list of inputs automatically by the class definition.

# Hint
# Creating an instance of a class with many initialization variables looks the same as calling a function with many inputs; put all 
# the values in parentheses, separated by commas.

# In the body of __init__(), you'd set the model like this:

"""
def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
    self.model = model
"""

class Car(object):
   condition = "new"
   def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
       self.model = model
       self.color = color
       self.mpg = mpg

my_car = Car("Delorean", "silver", 88)

print my_car.condition # prints 'new'

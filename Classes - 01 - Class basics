# Classes can be very useful for storing complicated objects with their own methods and variables. Defining a class is much like 
# defining a function, but we use the class keyword instead. We also use the word object in parentheses because we want our classes 
# to inherit the object class. This means that our class has all the properties of an object, which is the simplest, most basic class. 
# Later we'll see that classes can inherit other, more complicated classes. An empty class would look like this:

"""
class ClassName(object):
    # class statements go here
"""

# Instructions
# Define a new class named "Car". For now, since we have to put something inside the class, use the pass keyword.

class Car(object):
    pass

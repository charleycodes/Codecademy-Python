# When a class has its own functions, those functions are called methods. You've already seen one such method: __init__(). 
# But you can also define your own methods!

# Instructions
# Add a method, description, to your Animal class. Using two separate print statements, it should print out the name and age of the 
# animal it's called on. Then, create an instance of Animal, hippo (with whatever name and age you like), and call its description method.

# Hint
# Remember to pass self as an argument to description. Otherwise, printing self.name and self.age won't work, since Python won't know 
# which self (that is, which object) you're talking about!

# Your method should look something like this:

"""
def description(self):
    print self.name
    print self.age
"""

# After that, all you need to do is create a hippo and call its description method with hippo.description()!

class Animal(object):
    """Makes cute animals."""
    is_alive = True
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    # Add your method here!
    def description(self):
        print self.name
        print self.age

hippo = Animal("Lisa", 8)

hippo.description() 
# prints:
# Lisa
# 8

# Here's a simple example of list comprehension syntax:

"""
new_list = [x for x in range(1,6)] # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
"""

# This will create a new_list populated by the numbers one to five. If you want those numbers doubled, you could use:

"""
doubles = [x*2 for x in range(1,6)] # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
"""

# And if you only wanted the doubled numbers that are evenly divisible by three:

"""
doubles_by_3 = [x*2 for x in range(1,6) if (x*2)%3 == 0] # => [6]
"""

# Use a list comprehension to build a list called even_squares in the editor.
# Your even_squares list should include the squares of the even numbers between 1 to 11. Your list should start [4, 16, 36...] 
# and go from there.

# You can use x**2 to square a number, and x % 2 == 0 to check if it's even.

doubles_by_3 = [x*2 for x in range(1,6) if (x*2) % 3 == 0]

# Complete the following line. Use the line above for help.
even_squares = [x **2 for x in range(1,12) if x % 2 ==0]

print even_squares

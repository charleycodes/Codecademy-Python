# Sometimes we only want part of a Python list. Maybe we only want the first few elements; maybe we only want the last few. Maybe we want 
# every other element!
# List slicing allows us to access elements of a list in a concise manner. The syntax looks like this:

"""
[start:end:stride]
"""

# Where start describes where the slice starts (inclusive), end is where it ends (exclusive), and stride describes the space between 
# items in the sliced list. For example, a stride of 2 would select every other item from the original list to place in the sliced list.

# We've generated a list with a list comprehension in the editor to the right, and we're about to print a selection from the list using 
# list slicing. Can you guess what will be printed out? Click Save & Submit Code when you think you know!

l = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 11)]
# Should be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

print l[2:9:2] # returns [9, 25, 49, 81]

# Using the XOR (^) operator is very useful for flipping bits. Using ^ on a bit with the number one will return a result where that 
# bit is flipped.

# For example, let's say I want to flip all of the bits in a. I might do this:

"""
a = 0b110 # 6
mask = 0b111 # 7
desired =  a ^ mask # 0b1
"""

# Instructions
# In the editor is the 8 bit variable a. Use a bitmask and the value a in order to achieve a result where all of the bits in a are 
# flipped. Be sure to print your answer as a bin() string!

# Hint
# You'll need a mask the same length as a in which all of the bits are turned on (all set to 1).

a = 0b11101110
mask = 0b11111111
desired = a ^ mask

print bin(desired) # prints 0b10001

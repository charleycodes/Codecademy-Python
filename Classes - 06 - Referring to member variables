# Calling class member variables works the same whether those values are created within the class (like our car's condition) or values 
# are passed into the new object at initialization. We use dot notation to access the member variables of classes since those variables 
# belong to the object.

# For instance, if we had created a member variable named new_variable, a new instance of the class named new_object could access this 
# variable by saying:

"""
new_object.new_variable
"""

# Instructions
# Now that you've created my_car print its member variables:
# First print the model of my_car. 
# Then print out the color of my_car.
# Then print out the mpg of my_car.

# Hint
# To print my_car's model, you'd type:
"""
print my_car.model
"""

class Car(object):
   condition = "new"
   def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
       self.model = model
       self.color = color
       self.mpg = mpg

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)

print my_car.condition # prints 'new'

print my_car.model # prints 'DeLorean'
print my_car.color # prints 'silver'
print my_car.mpg # prints '88'

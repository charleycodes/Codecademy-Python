# Besides member variables, classes can also have their own methods. For example:

"""
class Square(object):
  def __init__(self, side):
    self.side = side

  def perimeter(self):
    return self.side * 4
"""

# The perimeter() class method is identical to defining any other function, except that it is written inside of the Square class 
# definition.

# Just like when we defined __init__(), you need to provide self as the first argument of any class method.

# Instructions
# Inside the Car class, add a method named display_car() to Car that will reference the Car's member variables to return the string, 
# "This is a [color] [model] with [mpg] MPG." You can use the str() function to turn your mpg into a string when creating the display 
# string.
# Replace the individual print statements with a single print command that displays the result of calling my_car.display_car()

# Hint
# Remember, in order to access member variables of a class (even while inside of that class), we have to use the self keyword and dot 
# notation to specify that we mean the member variable that belongs to the class.

class Car(object):
    condition = "new"
    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.mpg   = mpg
    def display_car(self):
        return "This is a %s %s with %s MPG." %(self.color, self.model, str(self.mpg)) 

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)

print my_car.display_car() # prints 'This is a silver DeLorean with 88 MPG.'

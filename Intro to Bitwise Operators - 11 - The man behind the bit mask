# A bit mask is just a variable that aids you with bitwise operations. A bit mask can help you turn specific bits on, turn others off,

# In the example above, we want to see if the third bit from the right is on.

# First, we first create a variable num containing the number 12, or 0b1100.
# Next, we create a mask with the third bit on.
# Then, we use a bitwise-and operation to see if the third bit from the right of num is on.
# If desired is greater than zero, then the third bit of num must have been one.

# Instructions
# Define a function, check_bit4, with one argument, input, an integer.
# It should check to see if the fourth bit from the right is on.
# If the bit is on, return "on" (not print!)
# If the bit is off, return "off".
# Check the Hint for some examples!

# Hint
# Here are some examples:

"""
check_bit4(0b1) # ==> "off"
check_bit4(0b11011) # ==> "on"
check_bit4(0b1010) # ==> "on"
"""

# You'll need to use a mask where all bits are off except for the fourth bit from the right.

# Great job computing the variance! The last statistic will be much simpler: standard deviation.
# The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. You can calculate the square root by raising the number to the one-half power.

# Define a function grades_std_deviation(variance).
# return the result of variance ** 0.5
# After the function, create a new variable called variance and store the result of calling grades_variance(grades).
# Finally print the result of calling grades_std_deviation(variance).

# Remember, raising a number to an exponent involves using the exponentiation ** operator.

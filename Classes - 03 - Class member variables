# Classes can have member variables that store information about each class object. We call them member variables since they are 
# information that belongs to the class object.

# Creating member variables and assigning them initial values is as easy as creating any other variable:

"""
class ClassName(object):
    memberVariable = "initialValue"
"""

# Instructions
# Inside your Car class, replace the pass statement with a new member variable named condition and give it an initial value of the 
# string "new".

class Car(object):
   condition = "new"
my_car = Car()

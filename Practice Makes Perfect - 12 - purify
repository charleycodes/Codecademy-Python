# Define a function called purify that takes in a list of numbers, removes all odd numbers in the list, and returns the result.
# For example, purify ([1,2,3]) should return [2]
# Do not directly modify the list you are given as input; instead, return a new list with only the even numbers.

# Your code should share something in common with the is_even() function you defined earlier.

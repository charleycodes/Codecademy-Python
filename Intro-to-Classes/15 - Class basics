# First things first: let's create a class to work with.

# Instructions
# Create a class, Triangle. Its __init__() method should take self, angle1, angle2, and angle3 as arguments. Make sure to set these 
# appropriately in the body of the __init__() method (see the Hint for more).

# Hint
# Make sure your Triangle inherits from object. Remember, class syntax looks like this:

"""
class ClassName(object):
    def __init__(args):
        # Set self.args = args
"""

class Triangle(object):
    def __init__(self, angle1, angle2, angle3):
        self.angle1 = angle1
        self.angle2 = angle2
        self.angle3 = angle3

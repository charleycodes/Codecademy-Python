# Let's see how the grades varied against the average. This is called computing the variance.
# A very large variance means that the students' grades were all over the place, while a small variance (relatively close to the average) 
# means that the majority of students did fairly well.

# Define a new function called grades_variance() that accepts one argument, scores, a list.
# First, create a variable average and store the result of calling grades_average(scores).
# Next, create another variable variance and set it to zero. We will use this as a rolling sum.
# for each score in scores: Compute its squared difference: (average - score) ** 2 and add that to variance.
# Divide the total variance by the number of scores.
# Then, return that result.
# Finally, after your function code, print grades_variance(grades).

# Welcome to an intro level explanation of bitwise operations in Python!
# Bitwise operations might seem a little esoteric and tricky at first, but you'll get the hang of them pretty quickly.
# Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits. In all computers, numbers are represented with bits, a series of zeros 
# and ones. In fact, pretty much everything in a computer is represented by bits. This course will introduce you to the basic bitwise 
# operations and then show you what you can do with them.
# Bitwise operators often tend to puzzle and mystify new programmers, so don't worry if you are a little bit confused at first. To be 
# honest, you aren't really going to see bitwise operators in your everyday program. However, they do pop up from time to time, and when 
# they do, you should have a general idea of what is going on.

# In the editor are the 6 basic bitwise operations. Click Save & Submit Code and see what the console prints out. All of them will be 
# explained in due time!

print 5 >> 4  # Right Shift; returns 0
print 5 << 1  # Left Shift; returns 10
print 8 & 5   # Bitwise AND; returns 0
print 9 | 4   # Bitwise OR; returns 13
print 12 ^ 42 # Bitwise XOR; returns 38
print ~88     # Bitwise NOT; returns -89
